                <p>The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and
                    relocations, currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is
                    located in Canada.</p>
                <p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North
                    America,composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada).</p>

                <p>The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with
                    five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004â€“05 season. Reflecting
                    the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the
                    eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three
                    in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.</p>
